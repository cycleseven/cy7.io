<!-- Workaround for a Storybook bug where Storybook's styles can be overridden
     by global styles from cy7.io's design system.

-->
<style data-preview-head="true">
  .sbdocs-h1,
  .sbdocs-h2,
  .sbdocs-h3 {
    text-transform: initial;
  }

  /* Reset html color: scroll overflow effect isn't relevant in Storybook */
  html {
    background: white;
  }
</style>
