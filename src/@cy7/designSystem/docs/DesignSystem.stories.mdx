# Design system

The `@cy7/designSystem` directory provides the base theme and core components for the website.

> **Note:** `@cy7/designSystem` isn't actually a separate package. But the project is set up to allow root imports from `src`. So it's valid (and encouraged) to import like this: `import { Logo } from "@cy7/designSystem"`

The **Primitives** and **Components** sections of this Storybook are the reference docs for the design system. Here's how to get started...

## Setting up the theme provider (and global CSS)

Wrap the root component in `<Cy7ThemeProvider />`. This component:

* Applies global styles to the document, such as resets and base typography.
* Makes design primitives available via the [Styled Components theme](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming).

```jsx
import { Cy7ThemeProvider } from "@cy7/designSystem";

function App() {
  return (
    <Cy7ThemeProvider>
      {/* Rest of component tree goes here */}
    </Cy7ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Components

Shared components are imported like this:

```jsx
import { Logo, Meta } from "@cy7/designSystem";

function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Meta title="My cool page" />
      <Logo />
    </div>
  )
}
```
