# `@cy7/designSystem`

The original design system for [cy7.io](https://cy7.io), written with Styled Components.

> **Note:** an experimental migration to [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) is in progress. You can try the new versions by importing from `@cy7/design-system` instead of `@cy7/designSystem`. See that package's README for more info.
