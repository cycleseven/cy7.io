# MaxWidth

A layout component that centers and restricts the max width of its children.

```tsx
import { MaxWidth } from "@cy7/design-system";
```

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Default">
    <MaxWidth>
      <p>This box is restricted from growing too wide, and is centered within the viewport on wider screens. You can't really tell in Storybook though, so you'll have to make a leap of faith here ðŸ˜…</p>
    </MaxWidth>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

`<MaxWidth />` is often used together with `<Gutters />`: see [the example in the docs for `<Gutters />`](/docs/design-system-layout-gutters--default-story#laying-out-a-page).

## Width variants

There are two width variants available.

The default variant is `regular`, as demonstrated above. This variant provides a nice maximum width for arbitrary content. If a `width` prop isn't provided, `regular` is used.

For text sections and articles, a narrower variant `bestForText` is provided. This optimises for readable line length and is the variant you should use for paragraphs and longform text.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Best for text">
    <MaxWidth width="bestForText">
      <p>Note how this text wraps at a narrower width. Easier on the eyes than the example above, hopefully. And easier to see what effect the MaxWidth component is having too!</p>
