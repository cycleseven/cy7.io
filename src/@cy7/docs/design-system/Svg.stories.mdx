# Svg

Renders an `<svg>` element, with some useful defaults to aid visual consistency and accessibility when dealing with inline SVGs.

- The `<svg>` is styled as a `block` element (instead of the default `inline`). This removes unexpected empty whitespace that can occur at the bottom of the SVG element. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22337292/spurious-margin-on-svg-element). Using `display: block` also provides a more reliable click target area when using inline SVGs inside links.
- The `role="img"` attribute is set by default, which ensures screen readers don't attempt to traverse inline SVG code.
- If a `title` prop is provided, it's rendered as a `<title>` tag inside the SVG tree. If not, the SVG is considered decorative and `aria-hidden` is applied to hide the image from screen readers.

```tsx
import { Svg } from "@cy7/design-system";
```

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Default">
    <Svg
      height={32}
      title="A red rectangle"
      viewBox="0 0 32 32"
      width={32}
    >
      <rect height={32} width={32} fill="red" />
    </Svg>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Decorative images (`aria-hidden`)

Inspect this story in your browser's dev tools to see how `aria-hidden` is applied when no `title` is provided.

> ⚠️ Make sure this is really what you want! Usually you should provide a `title` rather than hiding content from screen readers.
>
> In future, the props API will likely change to make titles opt-out rather than opt-in.

<Canvas withSource="open">
