# GutterBox

Used to apply consistent gutter padding across pages in the app.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Default">
    <Box css={{ border: "dashed 2px $candyfloss" }}>
      <p>I'm outside the GutterBox. That dotted edge is a bit too close for comfort, right?</p>
    <GutterBox>
        <p>This content is nested inside a GutterBox. It doesn't jam up against the edges of its container thanks to the horizontal padding the gutters provide.</p>
        <p>Try resizing the window. Note how the gutters shrink on mobile viewports to create a little more space for the content.</p>
    </GutterBox>
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

This component doesn't take any special props other than the default ones provided by Stitches: just pass some children through.
