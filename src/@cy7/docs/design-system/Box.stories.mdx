# Box

Box is a utility component that provides access to the Stitches theme.

It's useful for styling simple one-off components with the `css` prop provided by Stitches. It renders a `<div>` by default, but can render any element using the polymorphic `as` prop.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Default">
    <Box css={{
      background: "$candyfloss",
      display: "inline-block",
      padding: "$1",
      "& > p": { background: "$paper" }
    }}>
      <Box
        as="p"
        css={{
          fontWeight: "$bold",
          margin: 0,
          "&:hover": {
            color: "forestgreen"
          }
        }}>
        I'm a box!
      </Box>
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Note that theme tokens are available, as are CSS combinators and psuedo-classes.

Before reaching for `<Box />`, first consider:

- using another design system component that's more tailored to your use case. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- creating a component with the `styled()` API instead. Overusing `<Box />` components can result in noisy markup.

## Prior art

`<Box />` components crop up in many design systems.

* [Material UI's `<Box />`](https://material-ui.com/components/box/)
* [Braid's `<Box />`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Box)
* Theme UI's `<Box />`(https://theme-ui.com/components/box)

They were (I think!) popularised by Styled System in the React world. With Stitches, the implementation of `<Box />` is a one-liner.

```tsx
import { styled } from "@cy7/design-system";
const Box = styled("div");
```
