# Design system

The `@cy7/design-system` internal package provides the base theme and core components for the website.

Import React components and use them like this:

```tsx
import { Stack } from "@cy7/design-system";

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Stack space="3">
      {/* ... */}
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

## Components

All design system components support the standard `styled()` props provided by Stitches:

- [the `css` prop for style overrides](https://stitches.dev/docs/overriding-styles#the-css-prop).
- [the polymorphic `as` prop](https://stitches.dev/docs/api#as-prop).

Refs are always forwarded to the underlying component.

Check out the sidebar over on the left of the page for usage examples and reference docs for each individual component.


## Using the theme

The design system is not only a component library. It also enables consumers to easily create new components with the same design language via **theme tokens**.

Make use of the theme via the [Stitches APIs](https://stitches.dev/docs/api) that are re-exported from the design system package.

```tsx
import { Link, styled } from "@cy7/design-system";

// Create new styled components using the styled()
// API provided by Stitches.
const MyButton = styled("button", {
  textTransform: "uppercase"
});

const MyCustomLink = styled(Link, {
  // Theme tokens are available inside styled(), and
  // TypeScript can even suggest them to you.
  color: "$angrypeach"
});
```

Refer to `stitches.config.ts` for all available theme tokens.

## Philosophy

When styling new components, consider iterating on the theme and adding new components to the design system instead of writing new unique styles. Don't fear sweeping changes, especially while the project is young.

By centralising design patterns, the design system becomes more helpful over time, and visual consistency becomes the path of least resistance.

## Colors

These base colors are available via the Stitches theme.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Base color palette">
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.angrypeach.value} name="angrypeach" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.candyfloss.value} name="candyfloss" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.dijon.value} name="dijon" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.obsidian.value} name="obsidian" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.glasgow.value} name="glasgow" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.paper.value} name="paper" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Semantic color tokens make it possible to build design system components that adapt under alternative color modes, simply by having the color mode themes point the names to different underlying values. Typically you should use these in practice instead of referring to base colors directly, and you should feel free to add more aliases as required to support new components.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Semantic color names">
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.accent.value} name="accent" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.bg.value} name="bg" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.contrast.value} name="contrast" />
    <ColorSwatch color={theme.colors.bodyText.value} name="bodyText" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Refer to `stitches.config.ts` for the full list of semantic color names.

The design system also exports the raw hue numbers for the base colors. You can use these in HSL values to create custom shades.

```tsx
import { hues } from "@cy7/design-system";

const { candyfloss } = hues;
const candyflossLite = `hsl(${candyfloss}, 100%, 88%)`;
```

## Typography

Typography.js is used to generate global styles for HTML text elements like `<p>` and `<h1>`.

Simply render those components for styled text. Consider wrapping typographic elements in a `<MaxWidth width="bestForText">` component for a nice readable maximum line length.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Typography example">
    <MaxWidth width="bestForText">
      <h1>Hello, world</h1>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Magna sit amet purus gravida.</p>
      <p>
        At urna condimentum mattis pellentesque id nibh tortor id. Magna sit amet purus gravida quis.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A subheading
      </h2>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Magna sit amet purus gravida.</p>
    </MaxWidth>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

> ⚠️ The approach used for typography is under review and likely to change soon.
>
> The global styles applied to tags like `<p>` and `<h1>` break layout composability by including their own margins. Reuse of design system typography elements is also difficult in contexts other than [cy7.io](http://cy7.io) itself. For example, workarounds are needed to prevent cy7.io's global typography rules from clashing with Storybook's own styles in these docs.

## Color modes

The design system also provides alternate color modes. Components adapt to their environment when rendered inside a section with an alternative color mode active. [See the `<Link />` docs for an example.](/docs/design-system-components-link--default-story#color-modes)

The available color modes are:

- `darkSection`
- `warningSection`

To use a color mode, simply import it from import { ColorSwatch } from "@cy7/docs/doc-components/ColorSwatch"; the design system and pass it into the `className` of a container element.

```tsx
import { darkSection } from "@cy7/design-system";

<div className={darkSection}>
  {/* In this section, colors are overridden by the dark theme */}
</div>
```

In general, you'll probably want to apply the theme background color too.

```tsx
import { Box, darkSection } from "@cy7/design-system";

<Box className={darkSection} css={{ background: "$bg" }}>
  {/* In this section, colors are overridden by the dark theme */}
</Box>
```

> TODO: consider capturing this pattern as a `<ColorMode>` component.

## Layout

A key principle in cy7.io's approach to styling is that components don't make assumptions about the context in which they'll be rendered. That means design system components don't ship with built-in margins, and layout is left up to the consumer.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="No margins by default">
    <div>
      <Placeholder />
      <Placeholder />
      <Placeholder />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

To help avoid repetitive layout code on the consumer side, you can make use of **layout components** provided by the design system. For example, the `<Stack>` component spaces its children vertically.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Stack example">
    <Stack space="1">
      <Placeholder />
      <Placeholder />
      <Placeholder />
    </Stack>
  </Story>
</Canvas>


For more complex layouts, components can be nested.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Complex layout example">
    <MaxWidth width="bestForText">
      <Stack space="2">
        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        <Stack>
          <Placeholder />
          <Placeholder />
          <Placeholder />
        </Stack>
      </Stack>
    </MaxWidth>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

If you're not familiar with the concept of layout components, the guides at Seek's [Braid design system](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/foundations/layout/) and [everylayout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/composition/) that inspired this approach are highly recommended reading.

## Global styles

The design system provides a `applyGlobalStyles()` function. This inserts global CSS rules that apply:

- Font loading (using `@font-face`).
- Global resets based on [Eric Meyer's reset stylesheet](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
- Baseline typography styles for elements like `<p>` and `<h1>`. (See **Typography** below)

Consumers of the design system should call this function following the example in the Stitches docs. Ideally this should be in a top-level component like `<App>`, or a Gatsby layout component.

In the [cy7.io](http://cy7.io) Gatsby project, the `<Page />` component applies global styles for you. Since all pages should render this component anyway, you don't need to apply them directly.

## Responsiveness

The site's design is intentionally kept simple, with elements mostly stacked vertically regardless of viewport size. This means that mobile and desktop viewport configurations are typically well-supported by a single design already.

However, a single breakpoint at `(min-width: 900px)` is provided for situations where mobile and desktop variations are required.

The current goal is to try to minimise the number of breakpoints required at the design level. But more might be added in future, if the need arises.

## Utils

When using Stitches APIs such as `styled()` or the `css` prop, some shortcuts for common CSS patterns are available. Similar patterns can be found in libraries like Tailwind and Styled System.

- `marginX`: bundles `marginLeft` and `marginRight` together.
- `marginY`: bundles `marginTop` and `marginBottom` together.
- `paddingX`: bundles `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight` together.
- `paddingY`: bundles `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom` together.
- `size`: bundles `width` and `height` together.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Utils example">
    <Box css={{
      background: "$contrast",
      // Note how `size` is available as if it were a standard CSS property.
      // This sets `width` and `height` in one go.
      size: 50
    }} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Refer to `stitches.config.ts` for the full set of available utils.
