import { Meta as Cy7Meta } from "@cy7/website/common";
import { ArgsTable, Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

<Meta title="Website / Components / Meta" />

# Meta

> **Note:** the `<Meta />` component doesn't render any visible elements.

Manages `<meta>` tags for the page, similar to the [SEO component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/) suggested in Gatsby's docs. **Every page in the website should include a `<Meta />` component**.

Under the hood, the `<Meta />` component uses [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), so it doesn't matter where the component lives in the tree. By convention, it's usually placed near the root of a page component.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Meta } from "@cy7/website/common";

// Then use the component in your page like this
<Meta title="My blog post" description="Description for search engines." />
```

Titles are auto-suffixed with `— cy7.io`. The resulting HTML for the example above looks like this:

```html
<title>My blog post — cy7.io</title>
<meta name="description" content="Description for search engines." />
```

## Opting out of search engine indexing

In general, both `title` and `description` are required props.

Some pages shouldn't be indexed by search engines (for example, the 404 page): a `noIndex` prop is provided to help with this.

When `noIndex` is used, a `<meta content="noindex" name="robots" />` tag is rendered in the document head. A `description` should not be provided.

```tsx
import { Meta } from "@cy7/website/common";

<Meta title="Not found" noIndex />
```

## Opting out of the `— cy7.io` title suffix

In case you'd prefer not to auto-suffix the page title, use the `noTitleTemplate` prop.

```tsx
import { Meta } from "@cy7/website/common";

<Meta title="cy7.io — owen's wee website" noTitleTemplate />
```

In this case, the resulting title tag is used unmodified: `<title>cy7.io — owen's wee website/title>`

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Cy7Meta} />
