# Page

The root layout component that all pages are expected to render.

* Renders the page footer.
* Applies global CSS.
* Ensures short pages fill the available viewport height.
* Renders a warning about lack of support for old browsers on browsers that don't support CSS grid.

```tsx
import { Page } from "@cy7/website/common";
import React from "react";

function MyCoolPage(): React.ReactElement {
  return (
    <Page>
      <p>Page content goes here</p>
    </Page>
  );
}

export default MyCoolPage;
```

In order to maximise flexibility, `<Page />` is intentionally unopinionated about how to lay out its children: no padding/centering/etc is provided out-of-the-box.

Consistent page margins and centering of content are instead achieved with the `<Gutters />` and `<MaxWidth />` layout components from the design system. Check them out: they're likely to come in handy for new pages and templates.

## Props

Page doesn't accept any props other than `children`.
