# Link

Combines the look of the `<Link />` component from cy7.io's design system with the behaviour of Gatsby's `<Link />` component.

Three types of link are supported:

* `internal`
* `external`
* `email`

The link destination is always controlled by a `to` prop, regardless of the link type.

> TODO: reconsider if that is really the best API ðŸ¤”

## Internal links

Internal links are the default. These mirror Gatsby's `<Link />` API directly and should feel familiar.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@cy7/website/common";

<Link to="/another-page">
  Go to another page
</Link>
```

## External links

Links to external sites don't use Gatsby's `<Link />` component. Instead, a standard `<a>` tag is rendered.

External links always open in a new tab.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@cy7/website/common";

<Link to="https://google.com" type="external">
  Go to google.com
</Link>

// A plain anchor tag is rendered in the DOM:
// <a href="https://google.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
//   Go to google.com
// </a>
```

## Email links

The `<Link />` component can render `mailto` links too. Use the `email` type.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@cy7/website/common";

<Link to="hello@cy7.io" type="email">
  Email me
</Link>

// DOM output:
// <a href="mailto:hello@cy7.io">
//   Email me
// </a>
```

## Props

All props are forwarded to the underlying component.

In the case of `internal` links, this means you can pass any prop supported by Gatsby's `<Link />` component.

For other types of link, it's any prop accepted by the `<a>` element.
