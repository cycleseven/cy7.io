```

**`.storybook`**

This directory configures Storybook. [See their docs.](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview)

**`deploy`**

This directory holds code related to hosting and deployment of cy7.io. The site is hosted on AWS (S3 + CloudFront) and is generally deployed via a CI pipeline in Gitlab.

- `infra`: a Terraform config defining the AWS infrastructure used to host the site.
- `lambda`: a mini [Serverless Framework](http://serverless.com) project that defines AWS Lambda functions used via Lambda@Edge. These define custom server logic executed when handling requests in CloudFront.

The [Deployment](/docs/guides-deployment--page) guide explores this part of the codebase further.

**`generated`**

Auto-generated packages live here. Currently, this is used for a single purpose, which is to hold GraphQL types generated by [gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen](https://github.com/d4rekanguok/gatsby-typescript/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen).

Read the [TypeScript](/docs/guides-typescript--page) guide to learn more about using generated GraphQL types.

**`public`**

[Gatsby's build output](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/). Generated by running `gatsby build`.

**`src`**

The source code for the frontend site itself. Sub-directories `pages/` and `templates/` act [as they typically do in Gatsby projects](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-project-structure/).

- Gatsby automatically creates a page in the site's URL structure for each component defined in `pages/`.
- Components in `templates/` are used when programatically generating pages from data sources, eg. blog articles.
- Assets in `images/` are made available via [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/sourcing-data/sourcing-from-the-filesystem/) for use with [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image).

**`src/@cy7`**

The `@cy7` directory hosts the majority of the frontend code. You can think of this directory as a set of mini-packages.

- **`@cy7/design-system`:** reusable visual building blocks for pages on cy7.io, including the [Stitches config](https://stitches.dev/docs/installation#configure-stitches).
- **`@cy7/docs`:** code for the Storybook docs site (that's this one!).
- **`@cy7/gatsby-plugin-stitches`:** a minimal Gatsby plugin that integrates Stitches SSR with Gatsby, based on [this tutorial](https://stitches.dev/blog/using-gatsby-with-stitches).
- **`@cy7/typography`:** configures [Typography.js](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js), which defines global base styles for text elements. (⚠️ **Note:** a future migration away from Typography.js is planned.)
- **`@cy7/website`:** code that's specific to the [cy7.io](http://cy7.io) Gatsby site. Gatsby layout components live here, and so do utility functions to help bridge data sources to UI: see `@cy7/website/common`. Page-specific components live here too: the `@cy7/website/blog` and `@cy7/website/home` directories provide a home to extract components to when `pages` and `templates` start to get out of hand.

The [design system](/docs/design-system-getting-started--page) is documented here in Storybook.

Reusable components from the `@cy7/website/common` internal package are documented here too. Refer to the **Website** section.

## Imports

Webpack and Typescript are configured to allow a src-relative import style.

```tsx
import { Stack } from "@cy7/design-system";
import { Page } from "@cy7/website/common";
```

The experimental file structure of the project allows code under `src/@cy7` to be treated as a set of internal "packages", while avoiding the overhead of managing separate dependencies or repositories for each package.

**The above import style is recommended over importing individual files.** The project's build process will tree-shake internal imports: you don't have to worry about accidentally importing the entire design system. On the consumer side, this style keeps imports compact. It also makes it possible to tweak the internal file structure of a package without having to update consumer code.

## Where your code should live

Some tips for how to structure new code:

- If you'd like to extract one-off code from a page or template that's growing too large, the recommended home is a new sub-package under `@cy7/website`.
- Code intended for reuse across to the Gatsby project belongs in `@cy7/website/common`.
- Fundamental visual components form part of the design system, and live in `@cy7/design-system`.

Don't worry about "polluting" `@cy7` with new packages for code that is even more generic, or that simply doesn't fit any of the above categories. There's no overhead to creating new internal packages, and a flat code structure can often be easier to reason about than a highly nested one.

**Deciding whether your reusable component belongs in `@cy7/website/common` or `@cy7/design-system` can be tricky.**

Components named after generic UI elements like `<Button />`, `<Dialog />` or `<Stack />` are usually good candidates for the design system. Check out some design systems and component libraries like [Braid](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/) or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for inspiration.

Components that "know about" Gatsby don't belong in the design system. In particular, this means components with `useStaticQuery()`, components that make use of Gatsby APIs like `gatsby-plugin-image` or `<Link />`, and components that render to the site's `<head>` element with `react-helmet`.
