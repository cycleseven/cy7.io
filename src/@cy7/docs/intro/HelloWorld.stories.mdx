# cy7.io developer guide

Welcome to the [cy7.io](https://cy7.io) developer guide 👋

These docs are designed to help project contributors (realistically: future me) understand how the website is built and deployed, how to publish content to it, and the technologies and ideas underpinning the codebase.

📚 Check out the **[Guides](/docs/guides-setting-up--page)** section for a deeper look at all the above.

🧑‍💻 The **[Design system](/docs/design-system-getting-started--no-margins-by-default)** and **[Website](/docs/website-overview--page)** sections are reference guides. Here you can find out what reusable components are available in the codebase, and how to use them.
