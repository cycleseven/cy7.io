# Accessibility

Before deploying changes to cy7.io, consider the variety of ways users may interact with the site. Users may need to navigate the site via keyboard rather than mouse. Or that might simply be their preference.

Always bear in mind that browsers aren't the only potential consumers of the site's HTML: screen readers and crawlers may need to make sense of it too.

[This presentation on becoming an accessibility-focused developer](https://noti.st/aitchiss/feJCV3) is a great overview of common accessibility pitfalls that crop up especially often when working with React. Keep these issues in mind when working on frontend changes.

Cultivate a habit of checking the site is always navigable using the keyboard, and make sure it's always clear which element is focused.

Read the actual HTML being generated using the Elements/DOM inspector in your browser's dev tools. Consider whether there's a better element than `<div>` for the job. Make sure the correct semantic elements are used for lists and landmarks, and that the heading structure makes sense.

Browser dev tools such as aXe and Lighthouse can automatically flag many accessibility issues: using them is strongly recommended.

## Automated checks

The project is configured with lint rules from `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to detect common issues such as missing `alt` text on images.

In future, accessibility issues may be automatically flagged in CI using a tool like Lighthouse or aXe.
