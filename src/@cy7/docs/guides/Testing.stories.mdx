# Testing

The codebase contains some automated tests, but not too many.

* Tests are written with Jest, and can be run with `pnpm test` or `pnpm exec jest`.
* Jest executes all `*.test.ts` files discovered under the `src` directory.

## Philosophy

* Test coverage isn't measured, and high coverage isn't a goal.
* Tests are written if

* There's no requirement to test the rendering of React components.

For example, when writing a pure function that processes some data, it's natural to want to try it against a couple of examples and edge cases to make sure it's correct. Adopting a TDD style for writing this type of function tends to speed up the process if anything, and the resulting style of test executes quickly and is cheap to rewrite or delete if code is rewritten.

Tests could definitely provide a stronger pillar of confidence in future. The current approach is a tradeoff based on the nature of the project: there's very little in the way of custom runtime behaviour on [cy7.io](http://cy7.io) so far. And many categories of problems that are worth worrying about can be detected through type checking, linting, automated accessibility checking, or simply by running `gatsby build`.

## Future testing ideas

Right now, manually testing the site before going ahead with a deployment isn't demanding, but might become impractical if the site grows larger.

The main form of manual testing performed against [cy7.io](http://cy7.io) right now is simply to browse the site and check each page looks as expected. **Visual regression testing** might therefore be pretty useful if the site grows in future.

Another frequent manual process is ensuring all navigation still works by clicking links and tabbing through them to ensure keyboard accessibility remains intact. Or, clicking to a heading in a blog post and making sure the browser URL updates to a link with the correct anchor. Automatically driving these kinds of user interactions (eg. with **Cypress**) may be a good avenue to explore too.
