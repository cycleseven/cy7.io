# Blogging

Blog posts are written in [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/), and live in `@cy7/website/blog/posts`.

A [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/#using-frontmatter-in-mdx) block is required for each article, and you **must** provide a `title`, `description`, `slug` and `date`.

Note that the `description` is also used to populate the `<meta name="description">` tag for SEO purposes.

The `slug` defines the URL of the blog post, so ensure it's unique. The URL structure aims to be flat: blog post URLs are simply formed as `https://cy7.io/<slug>`.

Rather than auto-generating a date based on file creation or modification time, it's left up to the author to manually provide a `date`. This is the simplest way to support use cases such as writing an article one day and publishing it later down the line, or editing an error after publishing, etc.

## Markdown code blocks

Syntax highlighting is supported for markdown code blocks [when a language is specified](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting).

Currently, support is provided for these languages:

- `jsx`
- `javascript`

In theory this list can be expanded to include any language supported by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer), which handles syntax highlighting behind-the-scenes.

## `<CodeBlock />` component

Code blocks are rendered under the hood by a custom MDX component called `<CodeBlock />`. Usually it's nicer to use markdown syntax for simple code samples. But in MDX, React components can be rendered too, and direct usage of `<CodeBlock />` allows for more complex code samples that include console output or error messages.

```tsx
import { CodeBlock } from "@cy7/website/blog";
```

### Usage

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Code block with console output">
    <CodeBlock
      code={`
        // A named arrow function.
        // The variable name "double" is used as the function name.
        let double = x => x * 2;
        console.log(double.name);
      `}
      language="javascript"
      output={`
        "double"
      `}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Code block with error output">
    <CodeBlock
      code={`
        setTimeout(() => {
          throw new Error("oh no");
        });
      `}
      language="javascript"
      output={`
        Error: oh no
            at stackTraceExample.js:2
      `}
      outputType="error"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
