# Blogging

Blog posts are written in [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/), and live in `@cy7/website/blog/posts`.

A [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/#using-frontmatter-in-mdx) block is required for each article, and you **must** provide a `title`, `description`, `slug` and `date`.

Note that the `description` is also used to populate the `<meta name="description">` tag for SEO purposes.

The `slug` defines the URL of the blog post, so ensure it's unique. The URL structure aims to be flat: blog post URLs are simply formed as `https://cy7.io/<slug>`.

Rather than auto-generating a date based on file creation or modification time, it's left up to the author to manually provide a `date`. This is the simplest way to support use cases such as writing an article one day and publishing it later down the line, or editing an error after publishing, etc.
