# Blogging

Blog posts are written in [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/), and live in `@cy7/website/blog/posts`.

## Frontmatter

A [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/#using-frontmatter-in-mdx) block is required for each article, and you **must** provide a `title`, `description`, `slug` and `date`. This appears at the top of each MDX file.

```
---
title: "Overusing anonymous functions"
description: "Keep your JavaScript debuggable with named functions."
slug: "anonymous-functions"
date: "2020-11-14"
---

import { CodeBlock } from "@cy7/website/blog";

This is the first paragraph of the article, written in **Markdown**.
The `title` from the frontmatter is already rendered on the page,
so a heading element isn't required.

## A subheading

MDX can also render React components, like this!

<CodeBlock
  code={`
    // A named arrow function.
    // The variable name "double" is used as the function name.
    let double = x => x * 2;
    console.log(double.name);
  `}
  language="javascript"
  output={`
    "double"
  `}
/>

## Another subheading

...
```

- `title` defines the title used when listing the blog post around the site, and is also displayed in the browser tab for the generated blog post page.
- `description` defines the blurb displayed for the blog post in the home page, and is also used to populate the `<meta name="description">` tag for SEO purposes.
- `slug` defines the URL of the blog post, so ensure it's unique. Note that the URL structure aims to be flat, so blog post URLs are simply formed as `https://cy7.io/<slug>`.
- Rather than auto-generating a date based on file creation or modification time, it's left up to the author to manually provide a `date`. This makes it possible to edit an error after publishing without affecting the date.

## Markdown code blocks

Syntax highlighting is supported for markdown code blocks [when a language is specified](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting).

Currently, support is provided for these languages:

- `jsx`
- `javascript`

In theory this list can be expanded to include any language supported by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer), which handles syntax highlighting behind-the-scenes.

## `<CodeBlock />` component

Code blocks are rendered under the hood by a custom MDX component called `<CodeBlock />`. Usually it's nicer to use markdown syntax for simple code samples. But in MDX, React components can be rendered too, and direct usage of `<CodeBlock />` allows for more complex code samples that include console output or error messages.

```tsx
import { CodeBlock } from "@cy7/website/blog";
```

### Usage

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Code block with console output">
    <CodeBlock
      code={`
        // A named arrow function.
        // The variable name "double" is used as the function name.
        let double = x => x * 2;
        console.log(double.name);
      `}
      language="javascript"
      output={`
        "double"
      `}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Code block with error output">
    <CodeBlock
      code={`
        setTimeout(() => {
          throw new Error("oh no");
        });
      `}
      language="javascript"
      output={`
        Error: oh no
            at stackTraceExample.js:2
      `}
      outputType="error"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
