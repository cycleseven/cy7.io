# Meta

> **Note:** the `<Meta />` component doesn't render any visible elements.

Manages `<meta>` tags for the page, similar to the [SEO component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/) suggested in Gatsby's docs. **Every page in the website should include a `<Meta />` component**.

Under the hood, the `<Meta />` component uses [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), so it doesn't matter where the component lives in the tree. By convention, it's usually placed near the root of a page component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Meta } from "components";

// Then use the component in your page like this
<Meta title="Blog" />
```

If the `title` prop isn't provided, a plain title is rendered by default.

```html
<title>
  cy7.io
</title>
```

Otherwise, the title uses `| cy7.io` as a suffix.

```html
<title>
  Blog | cy7.io
</title>
```

## Props

<Props of={Cy7Meta} />
