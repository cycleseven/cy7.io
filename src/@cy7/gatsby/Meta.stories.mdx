import { Meta, Props } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";

<Meta title="Gatsby | Meta" />

# Meta

> **Note:** the `<Meta />` component doesn't render any visible elements.

Manages `<meta>` tags for the page, similar to the [SEO component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/) suggested in Gatsby's docs. **Every page in the website should include a `<Meta />` component**.

Under the hood, the `<Meta />` component uses [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), so it doesn't matter where the component lives in the tree. By convention, it's usually placed near the root of a page component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Meta } from "@cy7/gatsby";

// Then use the component in your page like this
<Meta title="My blog post" description="Description for search engines." />
```

Titles are auto-suffixed with `— cy7.io`.

```html
<title>
  My blog post — cy7.io
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Description for search engines." />
```
